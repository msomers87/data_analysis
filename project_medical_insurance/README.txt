1. finding out in which regions, at what age and from which sex people live unhealthier (more smoking, higher bmi)
2. finding data model to predict charges

Steps
Goal 1:
- convert insurance.csv to json
- convert to lists
- clean up data
- calculate averages: age, bmi, children, charges
- calculate counts: sex, smoker, region
- create loops to compare averages etc

Goal 2:
- - convert insurance.csv to json
- convert to lists
- clean up data
- create variables for input
- create functions to calculate error
- create function to predict charges
